Hamsters are foragers, and depending on species, eat a variety of seeds, grains, insects, vegetables  & grasses in the wild. A species appropriate diet should replicate this in captivity and common issues we see with hamsters who are fed inappropriate diets are picky eating habits (which can cause malnutrition) and obesity & diabetes. 

What An Appropriate Hamster Food Does NOT Look Like:

Many (practically all) commonly available diets on the market are heavy in pelleted extrusion with added fruits, flaked cereals, and few actual whole ingredients. Usually any whole seed included is just millet or sunflower seed. Many also have added dyes, and flavourings, and even added sweeteners like added sugar & molasses. These are all signs of a low quality hamster mix that you want to avoid.

Wait, no pellets? But I thought hamsters NEED a lab block?
