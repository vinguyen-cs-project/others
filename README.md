# School Projects

This repository contains different pieces of code that I've written during my school year, either by myself or with a small group.

## Cryptography

I've written the pseudocode and a part of the code for:

- A Python program running birthday attack on a hash function that takes the first 40 bits of the output of SHA256 in [BadHash40](https://github.com/vinguyen-cs-project/small-projects/tree/master/BadHash40) *(group)*
- A Python program that runs exhaustive search attack on an AES block cipher with 24 bit-limited key space in [AES128](https://github.com/vinguyen-cs-project/small-projects/tree/master/AES128) *(group)*

## Operating System

I've written the pseudocode for:

- A C++ program running graph reduction algorithm to detect deadlock state in a resource allocation graph in [DeadlockDetection](https://github.com/vinguyen-cs-project/small-projects/tree/master/DeadlockDetection) *(group)*

## Computing Foundations

- A C++ program that uses different methods of hashing and collision handling to efficiently store and manipulate data in [HashTable](https://github.com/vinguyen-cs-project/small-projects/tree/master/HashTable) *(group)*

## Computer Networks

- A C program that mimics a three way handshake between TCP server and client in [TCP-Server-Client](https://github.com/vinguyen-cs-project/others/tree/master/TCP-Server-Client) *(personal)*
- A C program that mimics a DHCP client-server interaction in [DHCP-CLient-Server](https://github.com/vinguyen-cs-project/others/tree/master/DHCP-CLient-Server) *(personal)*

## System Programming
- A Tic-Tac-Toe game between a server and a client in [Tic-Tac-Toe-Socket](https://github.com/vinguyen-cs-project/others/tree/master/Tic-Tac-Toe-Socket) *(personal)*
- Some Bash scripts in [Scripts](https://github.com/vinguyen-cs-project/others/tree/master/Scripts) *(personal)*
